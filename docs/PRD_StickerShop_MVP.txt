- Orders (order data, line items)
- Sessions (for cart persistence)

### Task 4.3: Payment Processing

**Recommendation:** Stripe integration for secure payment processing
**Files to Enhance:** `/workspace/cmhw2cyom00ldo6inw5h9uxqu/TheNunusJournalGithub/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`

---

## Phase 5: Production Deployment (Priority 5 - Final)

### Task 5.1: Production Build Optimization

**Action:** Configure Vite build settings for production
**Considerations:**

- Asset optimization and compression
- Environment variable configuration
- Error tracking and analytics

### Task 5.2: Deployment Setup

**Recommendation:** Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
**Requirements:**

- Static site deployment (for frontend)
- API endpoint configuration
- Environment variables for payment keys and OAuth
- SSL certificate setup

---

## Implementation Priority Order

### **Immediate (This Session)**

1. **Install dependencies** (`npm install`) - Critical blocker
2. **Verify build process** (`npm run build`) - Confirm project builds
3. **Test dev server** (`npm run dev`) - Confirm application runs
4. **Fix any compilation errors** - Address TypeScript/linting issues

### **Short Term (Next Development Session)**

1. **Complete auth context OAuth integration**
2. **Connect admin forms to state management**
3. **Implement basic backend API endpoints**
4. **Add error handling and loading states**

### **Medium Term (When Ready for Production)**

1. **Set up production database**
2. **Integrate payment processing**
3. **Deploy to hosting platform**
4. **Add analytics and monitoring**
