Document Name: PRD_StickerShop_MVP.txt

1) Overview
- Product: Online sticker shop selling themed sticker packs and individual stickers.
- Platform: Web storefront built with React/TypeScript (Next.js) using the existing design system.
- MVP Constraints: no real payments; product variants deferred to Phase 2; guest checkout allowed with reminders to signup for shipping tracking.
- Primary objective: Launch a fast, visual storefront with core eCommerce flows: browse, view, add to cart, guest checkout, and order confirmation, plus basic admin visibility.

2) Goals & Success Metrics
- Goals:
  - Visually engaging catalog with fast load times.
  - Frictionless guest checkout with signup prompt for shipping tracking.
  - Admin visibility into orders, products, and basic analytics.
  - Data model ready for later variants, inventory, and payments.
- Success Metrics:
  - Conversion rate Shop/Product Detail → Checkout.
  - Cart persistence across sessions.
  - Orders count and revenue (MVP baseline).
  - Signups driven by post-purchase prompts.
  - Time to complete checkout.

3) Scope
3.1 In Scope (MVP)
- Catalog with search and basic filters.
- Product detail with image gallery, description, and Add to cart.
- Shopping cart with localStorage persistence and quantity updates.
- Checkout flow for guests with name, email, shipping address; payment is a mock placeholder.
- Order confirmation with order number and mock receipt.
- Basic admin views: orders, products, analytics dashboard.
- Data model: Product, Cart, Order, Customer (guest support; accounts optional later).
- Signup reminder messaging during checkout without blocking guest.

3.2 Out of Scope / Phase 2
- Real payments (Stripe etc.).
- Product variants and variant stock.
- Inventory sync.
- Email notifications and marketing automation.
- Localization beyond English.
- Advanced admin features.

4) User Flows
- Browse → product → add to cart → checkout (guest) → order confirmation.
- Signup prompt post-purchase for shipping tracking; optional account creation later.

5) Guest Checkout & Signup Reminder
- Messaging:
  - On checkout success screen: “Create an account to track shipping, save addresses, and view past orders in your dashboard.”
  - Checkout step: “We’ll email a receipt. Create an account later to link this order to your dashboard.”
  - Post-checkout banner: “Sign up now to simplify future orders and shipping tracking.”
- Data for signup: email, name, shipping address optional; password on signup.

6) Data Model (MVP)
- Product: id, name, description, price, images[], category, tags[], stock, createdAt, updatedAt
- Cart: id, items: [{ productId, quantity, unitPrice, variantId (optional) }], total, createdAt
- Order: id, items, total, customer (guest or account), shippingAddress, status, paymentStatus (mock), createdAt, updatedAt
- Customer: id, name, email, passwordHash, addresses[]
- Variant (Phase 2): id, productId, sku, options, price, stock

7) UX & Content Guidelines
- Catalog: Thumbnails, titles, prices, quick view; keyboard accessible
- Product: Image gallery with lightbox, clear price, stock indicator
- Checkout: Minimal form with validation; UI mirrors existing components; mock payment
- Sign-up prompts: concise benefits copy
- Accessibility: keyboard, alt text, ARIA labels
- Performance: image optimization, lazy loading

8) Admin & Ops (MVP)

- Reliability: consistent UI
- Security: client-side validation; mock payments isolated
- Accessibility & SEO: baseline WCAG 2.1 AA; alt text

10) Risks & Mitigations

- Signup adoption: strong post-purchase prompts
- Variants: Phase 2

11) Milestones & Timeline
